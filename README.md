# 🔒 Fingerprint Door Lock Sensor

## Overview
This project is an **IoT-based Fingerprint Door Lock System** designed to enhance security by allowing access only to authorized individuals using biometric verification. It combines a fingerprint sensor with a solenoid lock and microcontroller to create a modern, reliable, and user-friendly security solution.

## 🚪 Features
- Biometric authentication using fingerprint sensor
- Level-based security
- Real-time access control
- Low-cost and efficient hardware setup
- Easy integration with IoT platforms for future expansion

## 🛠️ Technologies & Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- R305 fingerprint sensor
- Solenoid lock
- Relay module
- 12V power supply

## ⚡ How It Works
1. User places their finger on the fingerprint sensor.
2. Sensor verifies the fingerprint.
3. If matched, Arduino triggers the solenoid lock to open.
4. After a delay, the door locks automatically.
